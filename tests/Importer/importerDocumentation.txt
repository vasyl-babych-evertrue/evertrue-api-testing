Response:

{
  "s3_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/myorg/data/my_file.csv?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJDXMX5F3BAIMETLQ&Expires=1417719880&Signature=ufeZdHrJM8IRY7c4Nu18dg2ghjQ%3D"
}
List Jobs by OID

Param	Note
type[]	filetype of the import (CSV, TRANSACTIONAL_CSV, ASSIGNMENT_CSV, ASSIGNMENT_TEAM_CSV, JSON, NOTES_CSV, PROPOSAL_CSV)
filename	fuzzy match on filename
status[]	returns jobs with current status matching given value (NEW, FORKED, QUEUED, RUNNING, OK, WARN, FAILED, CANCELLED, PRUNING, PRUNING_FORKED, PRUNING_PENDING, PRUNING_QUEUED, PRUNING_RECONCILE_PENDING, RECONCILE_PENDING, FILECHECK_FORKED, FILECHECK_QUEUED, FILECHECK_RUNNING)
prune	set to 1 or true to only receive full imports
from	use millisecond timestamp to filter out jobs that occurred before this value
to	use millisecond timestamp to filter out jobs that occurred after this value
sort_column	which column to sort results by - can be created_at or status_updated_at. If not provided defaults to id
sort_order	asc or desc to determine sort order of results
limit	how many records to return per page
offset	determines the starting point for paging results
GET /importer/v1/jobs?offset={offset}&limit={limit}

Response: Paginated Job List Object

Create a new Job
Creates a new job

POST /importer/v1/jobs

Request:

{
  "s3_filename": "test_1382388534.csv",
  "type": "CSV",
  "source": "CSV",
  "compression": "NONE",
  "prune": 1,
  "notify": 0
}
Importer follows the following preset convention when deriving the path of a file:

{org_slug}/data/{s3_filename}

where org_slug will be derived from oid in the query params.

type is an optional field to hint what type a job belongs to, and defaults to CSV if absent.
type values
CSV
TRANSACTIONAL_CSV
NOTES_CSV
JSON
compression is an optional field to hint what format the file is compressed in and defaults to NONE if absent.
compression values
NONE
ZIP
GZIP
source is only required when type is JSON, and will always be overridden as CSV when type is CSV.
source values for type CSV	source values for type JSON
CSV	RAISERSEDGE
prune is an optional field to hint if the job should be run with all records not present in the file deleted, and defaults to 0 if absent.
notify is an optional field to hint if a notification email should be sent upon failure or completion, and defaults to 0 if absent. The recipients of the email are defined in legacy DNA ET.Email.Import.Recipients.
Response: Job Object

Queue Job for import
Queues a job for import. For a job to be successfully queued, the id field needs to be present in the Map Object.

POST /importer/v1/jobs/queue/{job_id}

Response: Job Object

Cancels a posted job before it is queued

POST /importer/v1/jobs/cancelled/{job_id}

Response: Job Object

Pruning
Get count of records staged for pruning
Returns an object that includes a limit, offset, total, and array of items. The items contain the remote id of each record set to be pruned.

GET /importer/v1/pruning/jobs/{job_id}

Response: Paginated Pruning List Object

Get count of records staged for pruning, based on type
Returns an object that includes a limit, offset, total, and array of items. The items contain the remote id of each record set to be pruned.
